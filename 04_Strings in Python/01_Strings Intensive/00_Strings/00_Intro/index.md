### Strings!

In python a string is grouping of text, and in python the string (`str`) class is very powerful and can allow you to do a multitude of operations.

To start, lets see how we can define a string in Python

1. Enclosed in either single or double quotes
```python
string_1 = 'hello'
string_2 = "world"
```
2. Converting a number to string using `str()` method
```python
x = 5
string_3 = str(x)
```
string_3 is now `'5'`
