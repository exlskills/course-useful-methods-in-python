### For Loops In Python
#### What is a For Loop in Python?

_The Python for statement iterates over the members of a sequence in order, executing the block each time._

What does this mean?  In the case of a list in python, this means that we are going through each value in the list.  For example if we had a list like: `[1,2,3,4,5]`, a for loop would **iterate** through each value.  This means starting at the value of 1 and going to 5.  

This is particularly important if you want to go through a bunch of data points, or take a specific action multiple times.

As soon as you see code that looks like it is repeating itself multiple times, you know that you have a candidate for a python for loop.  It should make sense when you read a for loop and it should sound like plain english.  For example to iterate through the list of numbers above, I would say out loud:

_For Number in list...._
