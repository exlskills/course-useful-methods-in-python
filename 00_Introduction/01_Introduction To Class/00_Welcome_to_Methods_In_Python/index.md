### Welcome to EXL skills!
#### Exploring useful methods in python!

In this class we will be looking at a bunch of very useful and exciting methods in python. These python tutorials should be used as a reference when you are coding in the case that you forgot a specific feature.

In addition we will be using a built in **python IDE** which means that you can practice your code inline and that you can take the code directly from **EXL Skills**

On the next page, I will introduce our IDE and how it is used!
